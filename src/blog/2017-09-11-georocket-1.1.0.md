GeoRocket 1.1.0 has just been released. The new version introduces a number of
useful features:

* We've added [properties]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#property-command), which are user-defined key-value pairs that can be attached to chunks
* Tags attached to existing chunks can now be [modified]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#tag-command)
* We've extended the query language and added new [comparison operators]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#comparison-operators): EQ (equals), LT (less than),
  GT (greater than), LTE (less or equal), and GTE (greater or equal). These
  operators are particularly useful to formulate queries based on the new properties.
* The HTTP interface was extended and now provides better [error reporting]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#error-responses)
* It is now possible to set the [default coordinate reference system (CRS)]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#configuration-queries) for queries
* We've added the possibility to [specify a coordinate reference system (CRS)]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#bounding-boxes) within a single query
* Support for UTF-8 encoded chunks has been improved
* It is now possible to [override configuration values with environment variables]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.1.0/#server-configuration).
  This is useful when using the [official GeoRocket Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/georocket/georocket/).
* We've worked hard to improve the overall performance, usability, and stability.

The update is recommended for all users.
