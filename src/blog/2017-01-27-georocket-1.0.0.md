The new GeoRocket version 1.0.0 has just been released. GeoRocket is a
high-performance data store for geospatial files. It can store 3D city models
(e.g. CityGML), GML files or GeoJSON data sets.

GeoRocket provides the following features:

* High performance data storage with multiple back-ends such as Amazon S3,
  MongoDB, distributed file systems (e.g. HDFS or Ceph), or your local hard
  drive (enabled by default)
* Support for high-speed search features based on the popular Open-Source
  framework [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/). You can perform spatial
  queries and search for attributes, layers and tags.
* GeoRocket is made for the Cloud. Based on the Open-Source toolkit
  [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) it is reactive and can handle big files and a
  large number of parallel requests.
* GeoRocket exists in two editions--an Open-Source version and a Pro edition
  for enterprise applications
