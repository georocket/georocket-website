tags: [GeoRocket, Announcement]
description: GeoRocket version 1.3.0 has just been released
author: mkraemer
lead: The new stable version of GeoRocket is out now!
---

Although the previous version was released only two months ago, the all new
GeoRocket 1.3.0 comes with a large number of new features, fixes, and updates.
We particularly focused on performance and scalability to make this the fastest
version available. We also worked on usability a lot and performed extensive
tests on Amazon Web Services AWS with huge datasets to further improve
GeoRocket's stability and use for real-world applications.

## Highlights

There are two features in this release that we want to highlight. A complete
list of changes can be found [below](#list-of-changes).

### Performance: Low-latency optimistic merging

Besides many performance improvements (e.g. better scalability during import
and indexing, faster queries, HTTP compression), we implemented
a new feature called _low-latency optimistic merging_, which tremendously
improves query performance.

In GeoRocket, the result of a query is a file consisting of the merged
[chunks]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.3.0/#glossary)
matching the query. In order to create valid output files, GeoRocket has to
look at all chunks before it can actually render them. The
[process of exporting a file]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.3.0/#architecture)
is as follows:

1. The client sends a query to GeoRocket.
2. GeoRocket forwards the query to the index to identify matching chunks.
3. It then loads the chunk metadata from the index and creates a valid
   header for the output file.
4. GeoRocket loads the chunks from the storage back-end.
5. Finally, it sends the rendered output file to the client.

If your data store contains heterogeneous XML data, GeoRocket has to load the
XML namespaces of all matching chunks in step 3 to create an XML header
containing all these namespaces. The time it takes to render the first chunk
back to the client therefore directly depends on how many chunks match the
query. While this is usually very fast, it does not scale arbitrarily and can
take a few seconds for a multi-gigabyte dataset.

However, if you know that your data store contains homogeneous data or if your
query matches homogeneous chunks---which is the case for most datasets
and queries we've seen in production---you can enable
_low-latency optimistic merging_ to skip step 3 completely. GeoRocket will then
render the first chunk to the client as soon as it has been loaded from the
storage back-end, which usually happens within a few milliseconds.

Low-latency optimistic merging always works for GeoJSON data. So, if you only
deal with GeoJSON, you can leave this feature enabled all the time. If you work
with XML, you should make sure your data is homogeneous and all chunks use the
same XML namespaces. If they don't, the chunks that cannot be merged will be
skipped.

Low-latency optimistic merging is available through the
[HTTP interface]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.3.0/#get-file) and as
a [command-line parameter]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.3.0/#search-command).
The number of skipped chunks (if there are any) will be returned through an HTTP
trailer or written to the standard error stream, respectively.

### Usability: Import progress

The command-line interface (CLI) now shows beautiful and detailed information
on the progress while
[importing files into GeoRocket]({{ site.url }}/docs/user-documentation/1.3.0/#import-command).
Watch the following screencast to see the new feature in action:
